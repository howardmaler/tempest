Configuring Tempest for Ubuntu 14.04

- A directory will needs to be created to hold the tempest log files. In a command environment log files are your
- best friend.
- Create dir for tempest config

1. sudo mkdir /var/local/log/tempest

- Tempest requires a configuration file to do work that is desired which should be located in
- /etc/tempest/tempest.conf. The Ubuntu Tempest setup does not create it when tempest is installing.
- There are several variations of the file in the alta3 github.

- Clone tempest files from github
2. sudo git clone https://github.com/alta3/tempest
